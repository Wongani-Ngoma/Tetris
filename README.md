Simple tetris game that can be played on the terminal.

Patch 1.1.0 Here's the new stuff

1.  The game now has an extra feature, the 'drop block all the way down' which drops the block and lets it land on anything, I saw this           feature in a modern tetris game, so I thought of putting it in this project.
2.  The game now has a sleep function placed right after the call to the fuction that prints the board to the terminal, I put it there            because it helps to prevent the game from 'flickering' too much and prevents 'ghost' blocks appearing on the terminal.
3.  Added a simple uppercase to lowercase conversion mechanic in the input function in Tetris.h Decreasing the amount of code needed in the       function.
4.  More commets in the code.
